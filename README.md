**Electrodo** - software service for climate-related assets and risk management to increase enterprise market value. Electrodo solves the problem of data/context integrity, data/context reliability, and trust for carbon-related assets lifecycle, climate-related risk management, and ESG reporting by using a standardized framework based on TCFD Recommendations and data verification on the blockchain. Follow [Electrodo](https://github.com/482solutions/ElectrodoDoc-meta.git) for more information.

This repository contains a prototype (ElectrodoDoc) that implements the basic functionality for the climate-related disclosure service based on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) and [IPFS protocol](https://ipfs.tech/). Our solution demonstrates ESG data/context management and self-verification principles in terms of climate-related disclosure's lifecycle: data/context collection and processing, data/context verification, and publication of sustainability report in line with [TCFD Recommendations framework](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/recommendations/).
